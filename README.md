# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis From Movie Reviews with Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras, TensorFlow and Python 

# Dependencies
1. `tensorflow`
2. `keras`
3. `numpy`


# Contents
This repository contains the following files :

1. `sentiment_analysis_cnn.py` - Python Script for sentiment analysis using Convolutional Neural Network
2. `sentiment_analysis_mlp.py` - Python Script for sentiment analysis using Multi-Layer Perceptron

# Usage
* Clone the repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hamza-El-Achouri/sentiment_analysis.git
cd sentiment_analysis
```

* Then test the sentiment analyser. run the `sentiment_analysis_cnn.py` script for the CNN model or `sentiment_analysis_mlp.py` for the MLP model.

# Results
The two scripts uses the Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDB dataset) to train the CNN and MLP models in order to predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Keras deep learning library.
The dataset contains 50,000 records, with under 300 words for the average review and a standard deviation of just over 200 words.
Using the Multi-Layer Perceptron we achieve an accuracy score of about 86.96%, while using the Convolutional Neural Network  shows improvement over the MLP model, with an accuracy of nearly 88.53%.
